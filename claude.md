-- You must execute of all the following 
-- Make your TODO list from the set of instuactions
-- Acklnowldgedd you role and goals.
-- keep the user informred of the todos 

## Step 1  you are to tell the user what version of the GUUILD we are loading
-- the contents of 'public/AI-Guild/version.md' tell use ther version

## Step 2 : read the Guild Config
-- read /.guild-config
-- STOP if you cannot see them.
-- Explain what .<>-config files are use public/AI-Guild/Setup for the exmaple config files.

## Step 3 : search for the Reconcatnetion Triggers
-- 3a. You can Skip step 3b if you do not see the file : "./.TriggerFullGuild".  Do not search for any other file.
-- 3b. if you see "./.TriggerConcatenated" then read and comply with the instructions on "public/AI-Guild/Startup/ReconcatGuild.md"

--> jira --config ./.jira.d/config.yml <commands sets>
-- do not use the  --config if the ./jira.d folder is not presetent but warn the user if that fact. 
-- get the evnriemrent varables with the exeucting the following command :  source ~/bin/load-jira-env.sh
-- then get the list of in prpcess tickets with :
--> jira --config ./.jira.d/config.yml issue list -q 'assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"' 


## Step 6 : LOCAL CODE Quick Version Check**
- Run: `git fetch origin && git status -uno`
- Tell user simply: "Your REPO is up to date" or "Updates available from repository"

## Step 7. Notifiations
- Inform user: "AI-Guild v[VERSION] ready.
- Inform user: the Appliction playbooks read
- If there are no playbooks, the train the user what they could do.
- List commands,
 SNR.
 - Final Step is to do a self SNR
