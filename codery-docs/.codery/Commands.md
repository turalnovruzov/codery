# Codery Commands Reference

## Overview

This document lists all available commands and directives that can be used within the Codery system. Commands trigger specific behaviors, role switches, and workflows.

## Core Commands

### System Initialization

- **START** / **STARTUP**  
  Initialize the Codery system by instructing the AI agent to:
  1. Read or re-read the CLAUDE.md file in the project root
  2. Check for and read .codery/application-docs.md if it exists
  3. Fully adopt the Codery methodology with subagents, workflows, and protocols
  4. Begin operating under the Codery system guidelines
  5. Confirm subagents are available in .claude/agents/
  
  _Note: This command ensures the AI agent is properly configured to work within the Codery framework. The AI should acknowledge reading CLAUDE.md and confirm activation of the Codery system._

### Information Commands

- **WhatsUp**  
  Summarize what you know about the current codery system and playbooks you have read, specifically by name.  
  _Note: You must NOT execute any BASH or shell commands for this directive._

- **Status**  
  Request current JIRA ticket status and work summary.

### Documentation & Communication

- **SNR** (Summarize, Next Steps, Request)  
  Main agent provides a summary, outlines next steps, and suggests next actions.
  
  Standard SNR protocol:
  - ðŸ”· **Sâ€”Summarize**: Recap what was accomplished by subagents
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Nâ€”Next Steps**: Suggest how to proceed based on findings  
  - ðŸŸ© **Râ€”Request**: Suggest appropriate next subagent or action

### Approval Workflow

- **Approved `<text>`**  
  Used after an SNR to accept the recommendations of Next Steps and Request Role, possibly with minor modifications in `<text>`.

- **Denied** / **Not Approved**  
  If not approved, return to KanBan or Mirror mode to reassess.

### Analysis & Debugging

- **WHY `<text>`**  
  Request an explanation of the reasoning or thought process behind a choice, action, or recommendation. Triggers Explainer Mode.

- **CLEANUP `<text>`**  
  Request an ESLint cleanup process. This is typically used to fix linting errors in recently modified code.
  - If the list of errors is small, fix them immediately
  - Branch-level lint errors outside your code changes can be left
  - If the directive is **"CLEANUP ALL"**, fix all ESLint errors in the project

### Subagent Management

- **/agents**  
  Opens Claude Code's native subagent management interface. Allows you to:
  - View all available Codery subagents (automatically installed by `codery build`)
  - See descriptions and tool permissions for each subagent
  - Understand when each subagent should be used
  - Create custom subagents (project-level)
  
  _Note: This is a Claude Code native command that works with Codery's pre-installed subagents._

### Meta Commands

- **Directives** / **Commands**  
  List all the directives (this list) to the user with a mini description. Provides a compressed list of all available directives.

- **Self-Report** / **Self-Diagnose**  
  Triggers the ðŸ”¬ Self-Introspective Analysis Mode for session review and learning.

## Usage Notes

1. Commands are case-insensitive but conventionally written in uppercase
2. Parameters in angle brackets `<>` are required
3. Parameters in parentheses `()` indicate options (e.g., I for Issue, F for Feature, E for Epic)
4. Some commands trigger immediate mode switches
5. All commands should be documented in JIRA when applicable
