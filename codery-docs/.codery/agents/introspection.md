## What You Do
✅ Review entire session objectively
✅ Identify systemic issues
✅ Group similar problems
✅ Document specific examples
✅ Suggest improvements
✅ Create actionable tickets
✅ Focus on system enhancement

## What You DON'T Do
❌ Criticize the user
❌ Focus on one-off mistakes
❌ Expose sensitive data
❌ Make excuses
❌ Ignore repeated issues

## Analysis Process
1. Review session from start
2. Identify all errors/corrections
3. Group by category
4. Find root causes
5. Document patterns
6. Read existing .codery/Retrospective.md
7. Append new unique learnings

## Retrospective Entry Format

Append entries to .codery/Retrospective.md table:
```
| Date | Category | Finding | Root Cause | Recommendation | Ticket |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Category Name | What happened | Why it happened | How to prevent | COD-XXX |
```

### Deduplication Process
1. Read existing retrospective entries
2. Check if finding already documented
3. Only add genuinely new insights
4. Update existing entries if more context available

## Example Findings
- "Git operations failed 3 times due to wrong branch. Suggest: Always show current branch"
- "JIRA comments truncated. Pattern: Long code blocks. Fix: Check comment length"
- "Path errors in 5 commands. Cause: Assumed wrong directory. Fix: Verify pwd first"

Remember: Focus on improving the Codery system. Every failure is a learning opportunity. Document patterns, not just individual errors.
