## Improvement Ticket Format
```
Title: [Category] Specific Improvement
Description:
- Pattern observed: [What happened repeatedly]
- Root cause: [Why it happened]
- Suggested fix: [Specific improvement]
- Expected benefit: [How it helps]
```

## LessonsLearned.md Format
```
Date | Finding Category | Description | Recommendation
YYYY-MM-DD | Bash Commands | cd failed due to spaces | Quote paths with spaces
```

## Example Findings
- "Git operations failed 3 times due to wrong branch. Suggest: Always show current branch"
- "JIRA comments truncated. Pattern: Long code blocks. Fix: Check comment length"
- "Path errors in 5 commands. Cause: Assumed wrong directory. Fix: Verify pwd first"

Remember: Focus on improving the Codery system. Every failure is a learning opportunity. Document patterns, not just individual errors.
