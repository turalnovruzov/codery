# Start Command

Initialize the Codery system by:

1. Read the CLAUDE.md file in the project root
2. Check for and read .codery/application-docs.md if it exists  
3. Check for and read .codery/Retrospective.md to learn from past sessions (if exists)
4. Fully adopt the Codery methodology and all its roles, workflows, and protocols
5. Begin operating under the Codery system guidelines
6. Start in Mirror Mode as specified in the Roles documentation

After initialization, acknowledge that you've read CLAUDE.md and confirm activation of the Codery system. If Retrospective.md doesn't exist, log an informative message and continue normally.

The Codery system includes:

- Role-based development modes (Mirror, Scout, Architect, Builder, etc.)
- JIRA integration for tracking all work
- SNR protocol (Summarize, Next Steps, Request role) after each interaction
- Git workflow integration (trunk-based or git-flow)
- Subagent delegation for specialized tasks

You are now operating within the Codery framework.
