# SNR Command

Execute the SNR (Summarize, Next Steps, Request) protocol:

ðŸ”· **Sâ€”Summarize**: Briefly recap what was discussed, built, or solved in this interaction. Keep it concise but informative, focusing on outcomes or decisions made to maintain context continuity.

ðŸŸ¡ **Nâ€”Next Steps**: Clearly outline the immediate next actions, broken down by who's responsible. These should be specific, testable, and ready for follow-through. Treat this as a live to-do list generated from the conversation.

ðŸŸ© **Râ€”Request Role**: Think about what role best fits the Next Steps. Then make an official request for that Role and highly summarize what Next Steps are.

This structured closure helps maintain clarity and momentum in the development process, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks and the next role knows exactly what needs to be done.
