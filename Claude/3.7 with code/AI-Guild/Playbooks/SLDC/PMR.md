# Epic System - New Folder Structure and Process.
# Legacy system do not use

Do not use this to build Epics‚Äîthere is a newer standard. This is legacy historical reference info only.

---

## Purpose

Epic documents capture major platform changes: system migrations, retirements, data model shifts, and major architectural refactors.  
They provide a phased, verifiable, auditable roadmap for implementation.
Note that some old Epics do not follow this document and we are not retrofitting old documents to new standards.

This README governs Epics created after the folder structure update.  
(Epics before this still live under the legacy system.)

---

## Folder Structure

Each Epic now lives in its own folder.

| Path                                               | Contents                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `/AI-Guild/Tracking/Epics/Current/Epic_<topic>/`   | Active Epic and all related documentation     |
| `/AI-Guild/Tracking/Epics/Completed/Epic_<topic>/` | Completed Epic and all supporting docs, archived |

Inside each Epic folder are documents. Build only the documents you deem necessary based on the scope:

- `Epic_<topic>.md` ‚Üí Main document  
- Additional supporting files (optional):  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Communication.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Summary.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_Approach.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_API_Changes.md`  
  - `Epic_<topic>_UI_Changes.md`  

---

## Required Structure for `Epic_<topic>.md`

Each Epic must follow this template:

---

### Status & Next Steps

This centralizes status across all phases.  
Keep this table updated continuously.

| Phase     | Status                                | Next Step             | Last Updated |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1:  | ‚úÖ Complete / üöß In Progress / ‚è≥ Pending / ‚ùå Blocked | Short action description | YYYY-MM-DD   |
| Phase 2:  |                                     |                      |              |
| Phase 3:  |                                     |                      |              |

‚úÖ No more updating status in multiple places. This is the one source of truth.

## Epic Process

1. Create Folder: `/AI-Guild/Tracking/Epics/Current/Epic_<topic>/`  
2. Write `Epic_<topic>.md` following the structure above.  
3. Optional: Add supporting files (Communication, API changes, etc.).  
4. Maintain Status & Next Steps table during active work.  
5. When completed:  
   - Move folder to `/AI-Guild/Tracking/Epics/Completed/`  
   - Update any cross-Epic references if needed.

---

## Best Practices

- **Markdown Only:** All Epics written in `.md` format.  
- **Small, Verifiable Phases:** Each phase should be individually stable and testable.  
- **Clear Status Tracking:** Always update the Status & Next Steps table first.  
- **Linked Documents:** Keep supporting files in the Epic folder itself.  
- **Rollback Plans:** Always be ready to revert safely.  
- **History Friendly:** Every major update should leave a clean audit trail.
