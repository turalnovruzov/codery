## Roles and Playbook

- Roles and Playbooks are documented as markdown files.
- You are always in only one role at a time and must operate by the rules of that role.
- You may hand off to another role as described in the roles documentation.
- You cannot change documentation or code without the appropriate role.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Purpose of Roles

Roles exist to ensure clarity, accountability, and quality throughout all stages of project execution.

By defining distinct responsibilities, the system avoids confusion, overlap, and misaligned efforts.

Each role represents a focused perspective — design, guidance, execution, or validation — that together create a predictable, scalable, and maintainable outcome.

Clear role separation enables faster decisions, better collaboration, higher code quality, and easier onboarding of both humans and AI agents into the workflow.

## Playbook Concept
