## Roles and Playbook

- Roles and Playbooks are documented as markdown files.
- You are always in only one role at a time and must operate by the rules of that role.
- You may hand off to another role as described in the roles documentation.
- You cannot change documentation or code without the appropriate role.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- Purpose of Roles

Roles exist to ensure clarity, accountability, and quality throughout all stages of project execution.

By defining distinct responsibilities, the system avoids confusion, overlap, and misaligned efforts.

Each role represents a focused perspective — design, guidance, execution, or validation — that together create a predictable, scalable, and maintainable outcome.

Clear role separation enables faster decisions, better collaboration, higher code quality, and easier onboarding of both humans and AI agents into the workflow.

## Playbook Concept

Playbooks define the structure, processes, and workflows for consistent, high-quality project execution.  
Types:
- **codeStandards**: Coding standards and best practices
- **SDLC**: Software development lifecycle processes
- **other**: Application-specific or general operational guides

You must operate by playbook guidelines at all times.

---

## Expected Behaviors

- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Document assumptions and decisions.
- Challenge unclear instructions early.
- Prioritize user experience, performance, and maintainability.
- Deliver work that is testable and traceable.

---

## Reading Roles & Playbooks

- To read your roles: read `public/AIGuild/roles.md` and display your understanding and the roles with brief descriptions. Select the appropriate first role.
- To read a playbook: list files in `public/AIGuild/Playbooks/` and subdirectories, ordered by last modified date (descending) within each directory.  
  - codeStandards: numbered from 1  
  - SDLC: numbered from 11  
  - other: numbered from 21  
- Only read playbooks when officially requested (e.g., "Read <#>").

##  :On Startup

Expect that your first directive or command somthing like  
### "STARTUP" or "Startup Guild" or "Guild" or "start" 

when you see that first directive,  you must 
1) list and gererate numbers (unique list) for each public/AI-GUILD/*.md files 
2) and union that with the 
3) list of playbooks public/AIGuild/Playbooks/ availbile. 
4) and union that with then
5) list of applction playbooks (all the *.md only) in public/AIGuild/Playbooks/Appications/<folder-subfolder>/*.md all sub directroes


## the directive 
### LIST PLAYBOOKS (or LIST INVENTORY). will restart the ### startup command

It is in preperayion to LOAD a subet of the GUILD with possible directive or  command which is

### READ # , #

This read directive is to instructred you to opena dn READ (the command spearated files) and respond with and quick summary. You are instructed to view the GuildOVerview number as a heading. 

## Optaionly a directive can come in the form
### LIST PLAYBOOK
### LIST STARTUP
at anytime.

## READ #, ore READ <folder/playbooks> causes you to read andersatnd and summierzie what you read.

## 'WhatsUp' is a directive
- do not read anything new, but
- summerzie your current understanding of the workflow
- itemize what you know about the playbooks (do not do a bash list or read)
- if you do not know of any of or 'read' playbooks - you must say "I may have lost that infomratoipn"

## Directives that you should know and abide by :
-- STARTUP, START
-- LIST <>
-- READ <>
-- WhatsUp (this directrive you must NOT do any BASH,  and only summerize whay you know about the curret guild and playbooks you have read specificly by name)
-- Open (I/F/E)
-- Close (I/F/E)
-- Status is a request to KANBAN to read the IFE # and summerzie what we are doing.
-- SNR (Summerize, NextSteps, Request Role)
-- SWITCH <role> (switch to that role and abide by its guidelines and contunie)
-- Approved <text> (used after a SNR to accpet the recommendations of N and R and my have minor mods in <text>)
-- Denied or Not Approve.  Go go KanBan or Mirror mode to reasses,
