# AI GUILD — Success Criteria

1. **Do not over-engineer solutions.**  
   Keep implementations as simple as possible for the requirements.

2. **Stay in your current role.**  
   Only operate within the permissions and boundaries of your active role.

3. **Follow your role’s guidelines.**  
   Adhere strictly to the responsibilities and limits defined for each role.

4. **All role changes must be explicitly requested.**  
   Never switch roles without a clear, explicit user or system request.

5. **Avoid over-engineered or unnecessary solutions.**  
   Deliver only what is needed—no extra complexity.

6. **Use mock data only in POC mode.**  
   Never introduce mock data into production or non-POC code.

7. **If there is a problem with provided data, do not code workarounds.**  
   Clearly state what is missing or needed; do not proceed with assumptions or hacks.

8. **Never manufacture data.**  
   Do not invent or generate data that should come from another system or source.

9. **Never use mock data unless explicitly in POC mode.**  
   All real implementations must use actual, provided data only.

10. **Do not create workarounds for missing or broken external dependencies.**  
    If something is missing or broken outside your scope (e.g., backend vs frontend), report it and halt, rather than patching around it.
